<section><h2>document flow</h2><p>think how you would structure the code, most tags can be made to look and act like each other, so don't start to think about styling before the structure is done.
    If the document makes sense un-styled, it is likely to make sense to a screen-reader too.</p><p>When it does come to styling, ensure that the user never sees a flash of unstyled content (FOUC)<sup><a href="#sources">[1]</a></sup>.
    This means never rely on JavaScript to help with the layout.
    waiting for javascript to execute (especially when enclosed within a <code class="js">$(document).ready</code>) simply takes too long.</p><dl><dt>how would you structure the code?</dt><dd class="hide">use <code class="html">li</code>'s containing <code class="html">h</code> tags for the tabs.
    the tab contents should be another list, but should the article titles for <code class="html">h</code> tags also?
    there is an arguement for this as titles are clearly headers, but think about a AT user pressing their 'h' key to skip along all headers on the page.
    I think making the titles also headers would be too much, best to leave them out.</dd><dt>How would you get the tabs to sit nicely next to each other?</dt><dd class="hide">the following display types could be used<ul><li>inline: the downside here is that you cant set height or width. To get around that you could rely on a block element inside to force a min width and height.
    You could also use padding (IE will add font-size to the height even with no text inside<sup><a href="#sources">[2]</a></sup>)</li><li>inline-block: This will allow height and width to be set on an but it is not fully cross browser compatible<sup><a href="#sources">[3]</a></sup></li><li>block: These elements will take full width of the screen, so <code class="css">float:left</code> will also have to be used.</li><li>position:absolute : put the element where ever you want, but now you have to specifiy a place for each tab.
    This should be used last as its not very scaleable and elements are taken out of the document flow.
    This means more work is still needed to ensure the rest of the page renders as expected with no overlaps.</li></ul></dd><dt>How to layout the tabs content?</dt><dd class="hide">as the content of each tab starts in the same position, position:absolute has to be used here.
    as the question suggest, this is tab content, as it belongs in the same LI as the tab header.</dd></dl></section>
