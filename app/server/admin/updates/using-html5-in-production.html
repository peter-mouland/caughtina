<section><h2>Mission</h2><p>Recently I have been looking into using html5 markup and seeing what is required to get it through to a live.
    The sites I tend to build have to be fully functional down to IE6, this is due to the number of people using the site trapped behind an old corporate build.</p><p>So when going as far as saying non-javascript users are also important, this adds a new level of challange; how to get IE6 to play nicely without JS?
    I'm not one to bash an old foe when he's down and almost out, but IE did give me problems.
    I wasn't expecting miricles, but after noting that even Firefox 3 (released June 2008) implemented some HTML5 features<sup><a href="#sources">[1]</a></sup>, I had hope.</p></section><section><h2>Methods</h2><p>The following all had their draw-backs, but given the right circumstance and a less strict set of requirements, any of them could be used to solve the problem.</p><dl><dt>Conditional Statements</dt><dd>I thought this was a strange idea, but one that would work if you are really keen to get IE to play nicely without JS.
    The idea is to only let IE render the tags it understands depending on its version number.<code class="html complete">&lt;!--[if lt IE 9]&gt;&lt;div class='section'&gt;&lt;![endif]--&gt;<br>
        &lt;!--[if gt IE 8]&gt;&lt;section class='section'&gt;&lt;![endif]--&gt;<br>
        &lt;!--[if !IE]&gt;&lt;section class='section'&gt;&lt;![endif]--&gt;<br>
        ...<br>
        &lt;!--[if lt IE 9]&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;![endif]--&gt;<br>
        &lt;!--[if gt IE 8]&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;![endif]--&gt;<br>
        &lt;!--[if !IE]&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;![endif]--&gt;</code>For me, this method simply duplicates too much client side code to ever be a serious contender.
    It also means that we completely lose the HTML 5 tags + their semantic meaning for older versions of IE.
    But I do like outside-the-box thinking behind it!</dd><dt>HTML5 Containers</dt><dd>This method wraps each HTML5 tag in its own container with a descriptive<code class="html">class</code>. The idea here is to never actually attempt to style or do anything with the HTML5 tags. Instead we just get the browser to style the containers.<code class="html complete">&lt;div class='section'&gt;<br>
    &lt;section&gt;<br>
    ...<br>
    &lt;/section&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;<br></code>We do end up with more elements in the DOM than I would like, but we also get the semantic benefit of the HTML5 tags.
    All this without JavaScript.</dd><dt>Pollyfil JS</dt><dd><p>I'm not a fan of copying a whole library into production code to solve what are potentially small problems, but they are worth a look.
    If no-JS wasn't a requirement, this might have been an option, so out of curiosity - I took a look anyway.
    I'm not going to compare and contrast libraries in detail here.</p><p>As CSS3 features is not my goal here, just a small number of html5 features<sup><a href="#sources">[2]</a></sup> working in all common browsers<sup><a href="#sources">[3]</a></sup>, I am moving past&nbsp;<a href="http://modernizr.com/" target="_new">modernizr</a>,&nbsp;<a href="http://css3pie.com/" target="_new">CSS3Pie</a> and a whole raft of&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/Modernizr/Modernizr/wiki/HTML5-Cross-Browser-Polyfills" taret="_new">other sollutions availble for non-structural HTML5 tags</a> and straight onto&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/aFarkas/html5shiv" target="_new">HTML5Shiv</a> (which is at the source of Modernizr).</p><p>A quick look at the source for this shim shows how little code is needed to get browsers to style unknown tags.
    Even going as far as ensuring printing a HTML5 page works.
    Along with this, it also replicates a javascript function (<code class="js">createDocumentFragment</code>), which could be very useful.</p><p>As it turns out, all I needed in the way of JavaScript was this excellent little snippet<sup><a href="#sources">[4]</a></sup> and along with the CSS<code class="css">display:block</code>we are able to get HTML5 tags to render in all browsers.<code class="js complete">'article aside footer header nav section time'.replace(/w+/g,function(n){document.createElement(n)})</code></p></dd></dl></section><section><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>HTML5 can be used today in all browsers that are widely used today<sup><a href="#sources">[5]</a></sup>, even without <abbr title="Javascript">JS</abbr>!</p><p>It a shame though that the HTML5 spec states that some elements are primarily for styling<sup><a href="#sources">[6]</a></sup>.
    I was hoping for the aim to be higher, to allow code to be more descriptive and give AT's more of a helping hand.
    It is rare that developers will allow the browser to pick a style that can not be altered.
    It is rarer still that a business would accept elements on their sites that don't match their own style-guide.</p><p> Overall, the semantic benifits these tags give will help future proof our sites as well as aiding <abbr title="Assistive Technology">AT</abbr>'s.
    For me, this makes the extra effort worth it.</p></section><section><h2>Other Notes</h2><p>When implementing my sollution, I decided to keep all my <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Application">ARIA</abbr> attributes on the HTML5 tags themselves.
    This is so that in the future, when more <abbr title="Assistive Technology">AT</abbr>'s do understand the purpose of each tag, the announcements made by screen readers are not duplicated.</p></section><section><h2><a name="sources">References</a></h2><ul class="references"><li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Firefox_3_for_developers" target="_new">New developer features in Firefox 3</a></li><li>HTML5 tags to be rendered are header, hgroup, nav, section, article, aside and footer.</li><li>Browsers chosen as being either important or popular IE6, IE7, IE8, IE9, FF3.6, FF15, Opera, Chrome, Safari.</li><li><a href="http://www.hagenburger.net/BLOG/Simple-HTML5-Fix-for-IE.html" target="_new">A Simple HTML5 Fix for IE</a></li><li><a href="http://gs.statcounter.com/#browser_version_partially_combined-ww-yearly-2012-2012-bar">Browser usage statistics for 2012</a></li><li><a href="http://www.w3.org/wiki/HTML/Elements/input/search">Example of an HTML5 element which is used primarily for styling</a></li></ul></section>
