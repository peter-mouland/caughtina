        h1 using html5 in production
        p Recenlty I have been looking into using html5 and trying to get it through to production.
        | The problem is this, Internet Explorer.
        | Now I'm not one to bash an old foe when he's down and almost out, but he does seem to be giving me problems.

        p The sites i tend to build have to be fully functional down to IE6, this is due to the number of people using the site during work hours trapped behind the corporate build.
        | So when going as far as saying non-javascript users are important this adds a new level of challange; how to get IE6 to play nicely without JS?
        | Performance ofcoarse is also a factor as adding too many elements to the DOM, or executing too much JS needlessly may be too much for some browser/operating system/hardware clients.

        p If this edge case is a small percentage, then why bother?
        | Simple, because even a small percentage of return visitors would turn into a large number missing clicks if we didnt provide a good looking, usable site.
        | Having said that, I'll still be more than happy when the people above decide that this number is small enough to be ignored!
        | The other reason is accessibility.  Doing what we can to help Assistive technology (AT) will in turn help more users.
        | I'm sure more AT's will suport these semantic descriptive tags in the future.
        | I also expect html5 to help Search Engine Optimisation (SEO), maybe not hugely important now, but hopefully soon.
