                p I want to expose the common problems and frustrations associated with front-end development.
                    | Along with these I will give you the sollutions and best practises in order to get around the issues or to avoid them all together.

                p To help put the theory into practise I will be building a tabbed document.
                    | Each tab will show a set of four articles which each contain an image, logo, title, tag-line and a call-to-action.

                p The end product should look the same in all browsers from IE6 to IE9 as well as Firefox 3.6 and the latest versons for Firefox (v15), chrome (v21), safari (v6) and Opera (v12).

                h2 code coverage
                p the issue being touched on here is
                    dl.contentList
                        dt document flow:
                        dd including inline, block, inline-block, float and overflow
                        dt css3:
                        dd when to use css3 or to stick with images
                        dt transitions:
                        dd css3 support and JS fallback
                        dt javascript
                        dd jQuery pitfalls and testing
                        dt devices:
                        dd responsive design and media queries
                        dt accessiblity:
                        dd what ARIA is and how to structure your document to make sense for <abbr title="Assistive Technologies">AT's</abbr>

                h2 layout desicions
                p important when the code loads you dont get fouc (flash of unstyled content).
                    | its also important each tab and content does not move position when switching.

                h3 the tabs
                ul
                   li structure of code (li's of headers containing articles of information)
                   li to get them next to each other
                   li inline: cant set height or width, so how to get around that?  (padding, or use a block element inside)
                   li inline-block: not cross browser compatible
                   li block: takes full width (so float left but now the container doesnt know its there)
                   li gradient: image or css? (css as most browsers support this and isnt too bad if an old brwoser cant see it)
                   li drop-shadow: image or css? (image as looks really bad in older browsers if it isn't there)

                h3 tab content
                ul
                    li does each tab have a heading and why does it matter?
                    li image as tag or sprite?
                    li icons as image tags or spries?
                    li how to get everything lined up?

                h3 tab switching
                ul
                    li attach events to each li or tab container?
                    li js debug
                    li how to hide the ther tabs
                    li display: none     (not on the page. old ie has trouble getting height and widths in js)
                    li visibility:hidden (still in document flow but not shown)
                    li transitions?

                h3 tracking user interaction
                ul
                    li what info should be sent?
                    li

                h3 device support
                ul
                    li responsive design
                    li tap event
                    li orientation change
                    li media queries

                h3 accessibility
                ul
                    li screen reader support (aria, live regions and structure)
                    li keyboard support
