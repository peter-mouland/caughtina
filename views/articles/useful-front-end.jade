                h2 Mission
                p I want to explain some common problems and frustrations associated with client-side development.
                    | Along with these I will give sollutions and best practises in order to get around the issues or to avoid them all together.

                p.listStatement In order of how I (sometimes) approach the job, here are the topics to think about;
                dl.contentList
                    dt <a href="#from-design-to-web">from design to web</a>:
                    dd how structure the html and some things the designs wont show you
                    dt <a href="#document-flow">document flow</a>:
                    dd pro's and con's of display types, float and overflow
                    dt <a href="#css3">css3</a>:
                    dd when to use css3 or images
                    dt <a href="#transitions">transitions</a>:
                    dd css3 support and JS fallback
                    dt <a href="#javascript">javascript</a>:
                    dd jQuery pitfalls and testing
                    dt <a href="#devices">devices</a>:
                    dd responsive design and media queries
                    dt <a href="accessibility">accessiblity</a>:
                    dd what ARIA is and how to structure your document so <abbr title="Assistive Technologies">AT's</abbr> can make sense of it

                h3 target design
                p To help put the theory into practise I will be building a tabbed document.
                    | A tab will show a set of four articles, each containing an image, logo, title, tag-line and a button.

                p The end product should look the same in all browsers from IE6 to IE9 as well as Firefox 3.6 and the latest versons for Firefox (v15), chrome (v21), safari (v6) and Opera (v12).

                h2 From design to web
                P
                    | Being able align items with each other, as in the designs, is also important to get right.
                    | The designs rarely cover all possibilities so you must choose which allignments are most important.
                    | Although this shouldn't affect your HTML structure, it may mean an extra div or two to help contain elements.
                    | These elements can then be moved on the page as a group using <code class='css'>float</code> or <code class='css'>position: absolute</code>.

            section
                <a name="document-flow"></a>
                h2 document flow
                p First of all, think how you would structure the code.
                    | Most tags can be made to look and act like each other, so styling shouldn't influence your decision.
                    | If the document makes sense un-styled, it is likely to make sense to a screen-reader too.
                p When it comes to styling, ensure that the user never sees a flash of unstyled content (FOUC)<sup><a href="#sources">[1]</a></sup>.
                    | This means never rely on JavaScript to help with the layout.
                    | Not because 'non-JS' users wont appreciate your effort,
                    | but because waiting for javascript to execute (especially when enclosed within a <code class='js'>$(document).ready</code>) takes too long.

                dl.contentList
                   dt how would you structure the code?
                   dd.hide use <code class="html">li</code>'s containing <code class="html">h</code> tags.
                   dt How would you get the tabs and the content of the tabs to sit nicely next to each other?
                   dd.hide the following display types could be used
                     ul
                       li inline: cant set height or width, so how to get around that?  (padding, or use a block element inside)
                       li inline-block: not cross browser compatible
                       li block: takes full width (so float left but now the container doesnt know its there)
                       li position:absolute : taken out of document flow so not very scaleable - would have to duplicate code
                   dt gradient: image or css?
                   dd.hide css as most browsers support this and isnt too bad if an old brwoser cant see it)
                   dt drop-shadow: image or css?
                   dd.hide image as looks really bad in older browsers if it isn't there)

            section
                <a name="javascript"></a>
                h2 Javascript
                P If there is something which needs Javascript (e.g. feature-detection to help with some complicated styling),
                    | then either use 'graceful fallback' or 'progressive enhancement' methods to improve the user experience.
                    | Which one will depend on you.  Do you choose to code for the browser most commonly used on your site, or the latest and greatest browser that was just released.
                    | As long as the most popular browser still looks awesome, works as intended and is fast it shouldn't matter too much.
