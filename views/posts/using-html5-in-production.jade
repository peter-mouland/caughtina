    | <!--| Performance of coarse is also a factor as adding too many elements to the DOM, or executing too much JS needlessly may be too much for some browser/operating system/hardware clients.-->

    |<!--h2 considerations-->
    |<!--p If this edge case is a small percentage, then why bother?-->
    |    <!--| Simple, because even a small percentage of return visitors would turn into a large number missing clicks if we didnt provide a good looking, usable site.-->
    |    <!--| Having said that, I'll still be more than happy when the people above decide that this number is small enough to be ignored!-->
    |    <!--| The other reason is accessibility.  Doing what we can to help Assistive technology (AT) will in turn help more users.-->
    |    <!--| I'm sure more AT's will suport these semantic descriptive tags in the future.-->
    |    <!--| I also expect html5 to help Search Engine Optimisation (SEO), maybe not hugely important now, but hopefully soon.-->
